        JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a widely-used image format
        known for its efficient compression, perfect for online sharing.
        However, when it comes to preserving image quality, especially for text
        or line drawings, converting to PDF (Portable Document Format) is often
        the better choice. PDFs are universally recognized and ideal for
        sharing, printing, and archiving documents, offering a combination of
        text, graphics, and images that maintain their quality across devices.
