            <h2 className="font-semibold">Which File Format Should You Use?</h2>
            <p>
              Choosing between PDF and JPG file formats depends on your specific
              needs, as each serves a distinct purpose. This guide will help you
              understand the key differences between these two popular formats
              and decide which one is best suited for your use case.
            </p>

            <h2 className="mt-1 font-semibold">What is a JPG?</h2>
            <p>
              The <strong>JPG</strong> image format was developed by the{" "}
              <strong>Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)</strong> in 1992.
              While commonly referred to as &#34;JPEG,&#34; it is often
              shortened to &#34;JPG&#34; due to earlier file-naming limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              JPG files are designed to reduce image file sizes through a
              process known as <strong>lossy compression</strong>. This
              compression permanently removes certain image data to create
              smaller file sizes, making JPG an ideal choice for sharing and
              displaying images on websites. However, this compression can
              result in some loss of image quality, especially when the file is
              repeatedly saved and compressed.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>When to Use JPG?</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Optimizing images for websites to improve page load speeds.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sharing photos and images over email or social media where
                smaller file sizes are essential.
              </li>
              <li>Reducing storage space for image-heavy files.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="mt-1 font-semibold">What is a PDF?</h2>
            <p>
              The <strong>Portable Document Format (PDF)</strong>, created by
              Adobe, is the gold standard for sharing digital documents. Unlike
              JPG, PDF is a document format that ensures your file is preserved
              exactly as intended, regardless of the device or platform used to
              open it.
            </p>
            <p>
              PDFs are highly versatile, allowing you to combine images, text,
              and graphics into a single file. They are perfect for storing and
              sharing multi-page documents, presentations, and digitized forms.
              Additionally, PDFs maintain consistent formatting and are easily
              customizable for printing or editing purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>When to Use PDF?</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Sharing documents or images that must maintain their original
                formatting across devices.
              </li>
              <li>
                Combining multiple images, text, or scanned documents into one
                cohesive file.
              </li>
              <li>Creating files for professional printing or archiving.</li>
